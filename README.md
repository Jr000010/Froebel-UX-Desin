# Froebel-UX-Desin

#### froebelschool.co.ke
### Definition and purpose
This design describes a website that should help a school with their communications with its stakeholders, as well as attract other audiences that don’t interact with them yet. I created it to make these operations easier to manage. Parents or guardians who are looking for a place for their children to learn can browse the website to learn more about the school. If they are satisfied they can send their details and begin the admission process online. External parties who want to supply their products to the school, or offer sponsorship can also send their messages and proposals through the website.

### Approach
My approach when designing this “froebelschool.co.ke” was to have a solution that would market the school adequately to its audiences, in this case being parents or guardians and sponsors. Additionally it should provide an interface where two way communication would be convenient to both parties.

### The User Experience
When a user visits the website, they should come to a judgment that the school has credibility. They will conclude this after seeing that it has served its community for several years by graduating many students. Parents browsing through the website will see that it is an environment conducive enough for them to bring their child to learn. Potential sponsors will see the various activities the school has been involved with and see the impact it has had in developing more than just the children’s education. This will be an encouragement and likely make them consider helping the school any way they can. With an active website, business suppliers can also evaluate the school and see the value they can get from partnering together before sending their proposals.
To enable all these processes, the website will have a homepage, an about us page, an application page, a contact page, a gallery and a notices page.

This website should overall be able to help the school engage with its community and therefore improve their operations depending on the feedback they get from this online interaction.
